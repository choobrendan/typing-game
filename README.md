# typing-game

This game requires players to type as many words as they can in a given time. After they have typed one word correctly, the other word will appear. The game contains:

● Game name (Can be anything relevant)
● Brief instruction of the game
● Countdown timer
● Score
● Start button
● The word to type

When the user types the word correctly, a green highlight will appear on the word, but will not appear if the word has not been typed.
(e.g., if the user is typing the first letter “A” in the word “ADDITIONAL”, background color to the first letter “A” only is applied. [e.g., ADDITIONAL → √ ], the other “A” in “ADDITIONAL” won’t be colored [e.g., ADDITIONAL → X ]).
